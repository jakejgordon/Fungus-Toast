# Fungus Toast – Technical Overview

> **📚 Related Documentation**: For practical simulation commands and debugging, see [SIMULATION_HELPER.md](SIMULATION_HELPER.md)

## Project Description

**Fungus Toast** is a turn-based strategy game built in Unity where players control rival fungal colonies vying for dominance over the surface of a slice of bread. The game features:

- Grid-based territory control
- Probabilistic mycelial growth and decay
- A mutation tree system (with point upgrades)
- Toxin mechanics and cell death
- Drafting for powerful and (sometimes) unique abilities
- Simulation and AI for automated testing and balance

The core codebase is split into a **Unity** front-end and a **headless simulation engine** for fast AI-driven testing. All game logic, state changes, and events are centralized in the `FungusToast.Core` project for maintainability and extensibility.

### **Phase Details**

#### **Mutation Phase**
- **Purpose**: Strategic resource allocation and progression
- **Duration**: Variable (human player controlled, AI instant)
- **Key Mechanics**:
  - Players spend earned mutation points on upgrades
  - Prerequisites must be satisfied for each mutation
  - Auto-upgrades trigger based on mutation levels
  - Human player can bank points for future rounds
  - AI players use predefined spending strategies

#### **Growth Phase**
- **Purpose**: Territory expansion and board control
- **Duration**: 5 growth cycles per round
- **Key Mechanics**:
  - Each living cell attempts to expand to adjacent tiles
  - Growth chance modified by mutations and board state
  - Failed growth attempts tracked for decay phase effects
  - Pre/post growth effects trigger mutation abilities
  - Diagonal growth mutations provide additional directions

#### **Decay Phase**
- **Purpose**: Population control and death mechanics
- **Duration**: Single evaluation per round
- **Key Mechanics**:
  - All living cells evaluated for death probability
  - Death reasons: Age, Randomness, Mutation effects
  - Toxin placement and spore effects
  - Necrophytic Bloom activation at occupancy threshold
  - Board state finalized for next round

#### **Mycovariant Draft Phase**
- **Purpose**: Strategic ability acquisition
- **Duration**: Interrupts normal round flow
- **Key Mechanics**:
  - Triggers on specific round (MycovariantGameBalance.MycovariantSelectionTriggerRound)
  - Draft order: fewest living cells first
  - Players select from unique ability pool
  - Abilities provide powerful, sometimes game-changing effects
  - Draft size configurable (MycovariantGameBalance.MycovariantSelectionDraftSize)

### **Implementation Guidelines**

#### **Phase Runner Pattern**
```csharp
// Each phase should implement this pattern:
public class PhaseRunner : MonoBehaviour
{
    public void Initialize(GameBoard board, List<Player> players, GridVisualizer gridVisualizer);
    public void StartPhase();
    private IEnumerator RunPhase();
}
```

#### **Event-Driven Architecture**
- **Pre-phase events**: Allow mutations to prepare
- **Phase events**: Core phase logic execution  
- **Post-phase events**: Cleanup and state updates
- **Observer pattern**: UI updates and analytics

#### **State Management**
- **Board state**: Centralized in GameBoard class
- **Player state**: Mutation levels, points, abilities
- **Round context**: Current round, growth cycle, phase
- **Event tracking**: Death reasons, effect counts, analytics

#### **Timing and Balance**
- **Growth cycles**: 5 per round (GameBalance.TotalGrowthCycles)
- **Draft trigger**: Configurable round (MycovariantGameBalance.MycovariantSelectionTriggerRound)
- **Endgame**: Based on board occupancy threshold
- **Phase timing**: Configurable delays for UI feedback

## Fungal Cell and Toxin Event Terminology

Fungus Toast uses precise terminology for all game state changes to ensure code, analytics, simulation, and UI remain unambiguous. This section defines the canonical event and method names for all key cell and toxin transitions.

### Fungal Cell Placement & Replacement

| **Action**                                   | **Event/Method Name** | **Description**                                                                        |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Place new living cell in **empty** tile      | `Colonize`            | A fungal cell spreads into an unoccupied (empty) tile.                                 |
| Place new living cell over **any dead cell** | `Reclaim`             | A fungal cell revives one of its own dead cells, returning it to life.                 |
| Place new living cell over **enemy living cell** | `Infest`         | A fungal cell kills an enemy's living cell, then occupies the tile with its own cell.  |

### Toxin Tile Placement & Cell Death

| **Action**                                     | **Event/Method Name** | **Description**                                                                              |
|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Place toxin in **empty** or **dead** cell      | `Toxify`              | A toxin is introduced to an empty tile or a dead cell, contaminating the tile.               |
| Place toxin over a **living cell**             | `Poison`              | A living cell is killed and converted into a toxin tile (distinct from Toxify for clarity).  |

#### Summary Table

| **Source State**   | **Target State**      | **Event/Method** |
|--------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Empty              | Living Cell           | Colonize         |
| Own Dead Cell      | Living Cell           | Reclaim          |
| Enemy Dead Cell    | Living Cell           | Reclaim          |
| Enemy Living Cell  | Living Cell           | Infest           |
| Empty / Dead Cell  | Toxin                 | Toxify           |
| Living Cell        | Toxin                 | Poison           |

**Key distinctions:**

- **Colonize** – Always for new growth in empty tiles.
- **Reclaim** – Restores a player's own dead cells.
- **Infest** – Overtakes an enemy's dead or living cell.
- **Toxify** – Places toxin in empty or dead cells.
- **Poison** – Kills a living cell and converts it to toxin.

## Mutation Upgrade Tree Guiding Principles

The mutation prerequisite system is crucial for game balance, encouraging strategic diversity, and preventing early access to powerful mutations. These principles ensure a healthy progression system that rewards thoughtful planning while maintaining accessibility.

### Core Principles

#### 1. Category Diversification
- **Rule**: High-tier mutations should require prerequisites from **different categories** to encourage strategic diversity
- **Rationale**: Prevents players from specializing too heavily in one category early on
- **Example**: A Tier 4 Growth mutation should require at least one non-Growth prerequisite
- **Implementation**: Tier 4+ mutations should have prerequisites spanning at least 2 different categories

#### 2. Tier Progression Limits
- **Rule**: No mutation should require more than **2 prerequisites** from the same tier
- **Rationale**: Prevents "tier rushing" where players skip entire tiers by over-investing in one tier
- **Example**: A Tier 4 mutation shouldn't require 3+ Tier 2 mutations
- **Exception**: Related mutations (like all 4 tendrils) can be treated as a single "system" requirement

#### 3. Prerequisite Depth Control
- **Rule**: No mutation should have a prerequisite chain longer than **3 levels deep**
- **Rationale**: Prevents overly complex dependency chains that create "dead end" builds
- **Example**: Avoid chains like A → B → C → D where each requires the previous
- **Implementation**: Maximum chain depth should be enforced in `MutationRepository.BuildFullMutationSet()`

#### 4. Cross-Category Synergy
- **Rule**: High-tier mutations should demonstrate **thematic synergy** between their prerequisites
- **Rationale**: Makes prerequisite choices feel meaningful and logical
- **Example**: A "Necrotoxic Conversion" mutation requiring both toxin and death-related prerequisites
- **Implementation**: Prerequisites should support the mutation's theme and mechanics

#### 5. Early Game Accessibility
- **Rule**: Tier 1 mutations should have **no prerequisites** (already followed)
- **Rule**: Tier 2 mutations should require **only Tier 1 prerequisites** (mostly followed)
- **Rationale**: Ensures players have meaningful choices from the start
- **Implementation**: All Tier 1 mutations are root mutations, Tier 2 mutations only reference Tier 1s

#### 6. Power Gating
- **Rule**: The total prerequisite level requirement should scale appropriately with mutation power
- **Rationale**: More powerful mutations should require more investment in prerequisites
- **Example**: A Tier 5 mutation might require 8+ total levels across prerequisites
- **Implementation**: Higher tiers should require higher total prerequisite levels

#### 7. Avoid Circular Dependencies
- **Rule**: No mutation should create circular prerequisite relationships
- **Rationale**: Prevents infinite loops and ensures all mutations are reachable
- **Implementation**: Prerequisite chains should form a directed acyclic graph (DAG)

### Implementation Guidelines

#### Prerequisite Level Requirements
- **Tier 2**: 5-15 total prerequisite levels
- **Tier 3**: 10-25 total prerequisite levels  
- **Tier 4**: 15-35 total prerequisite levels
- **Tier 5**: 25-50 total prerequisite levels

#### Category Distribution
- **Tier 3+**: Should require prerequisites from at least 2 different categories
- **Tier 4+**: Should require prerequisites from at least 2 different categories, with one being non-primary
- **Tier 5**: Should demonstrate clear cross-category synergy

#### Validation Rules
When adding new mutations to `MutationRepository.cs`:

1. **Check category diversity**: Ensure prerequisites span multiple categories for Tier 3+
2. **Verify tier progression**: No more than 2 prerequisites from the same tier
3. **Calculate total levels**: Ensure prerequisite levels scale with mutation tier
4. **Test reachability**: Verify the mutation is reachable from root mutations
5. **Review thematic synergy**: Prerequisites should support the mutation's theme

### Current Issues to Address

1. **Necrophytic Bloom Chain**: `Necrosporulation → Sporocidal Bloom → Necrophytic Bloom` (3-deep chain, all same category)
2. **Fungicide Specialization**: Many high-tier fungicide mutations only require other fungicide mutations
3. **Tier 5 Requirements**: Some Tier 5 mutations have very low prerequisite requirements (e.g., Hyperadaptive Drift only needs 2 levels each of Tier 1s)

### Code Examples

#### Good Prerequisite Structure
```csharp
// Tier 4: Cross-category, thematic synergy
MakeChild(new Mutation(
    id: MutationIds.RegenerativeHyphae,
    // ... mutation definition
),
new MutationPrerequisite(MutationIds.Necrosporulation, 1),     // CellularResilience
new MutationPrerequisite(MutationIds.MycotropicInduction, 1)); // Growth
```

#### Problematic Prerequisite Structure
```csharp
// Tier 4: All same category, deep chain
MakeChild(new Mutation(
    id: MutationIds.NecrophyticBloom,
    // ... mutation definition
),
new MutationPrerequisite(MutationIds.SporocidalBloom, 1)); // Requires Sporocidal Bloom → Necrosporulation chain
```

## Running Simulations with Cursor

Fungus Toast supports automated simulation runs for AI testing, balance, and analytics. To streamline this process, a PowerShell script (`run_simulation.ps1`) is provided in the repository root. This script ensures reliable, repeatable simulation runs and seamless integration with Cursor for automated result analysis.

### Simulation Workflow

1. **Builds First:**
   - The script automatically builds both `FungusToast.Core` and `FungusToast.Simulation` before running any simulation, ensuring all code is up to date.

2. **Unique Output Files:**
   - Each simulation run generates a unique output filename using an ISO 8601 datetime stamp (e.g., `sim_output_2025-06-30T12-26-10.txt`).
   - If you specify `--output <filename>`, that name is used instead.
   - Output files are written to `FungusToast.Simulation/bin/Debug/net8.0/SimulationOutput/`.

3. **Launching in a New Window:**
   - The simulation is launched in a new PowerShell window, allowing you to monitor live console output independently of Cursor.

4. **Automatic Waiting and Completion Detection:**
   - The script blocks until the simulation process in the new window has fully exited.
   - When the simulation is complete, the main console (and Cursor) will display:
     ```
     Simulation process has exited.
     ```
   - This message is a reliable signal for Cursor (or any automation) to begin reading and analyzing the output file.

5. **How to Run a Simulation:**
   - From the repository root, run:
     ```powershell
     .\run_simulation.ps1 --games 3 --players 8
     ```
   - You may pass any parameters accepted by `Program.cs` (e.g., `--games`, `--players`, `--output`).
   - The script will print the output filename for reference.

6. **How Cursor Interacts:**
   - Cursor (and this AI assistant) will:
     - Wait for the script to finish and for the "Simulation process has exited." message to appear in the console.
     - Only then, read the output file (using the printed filename) and analyze the results.
   - This ensures results are never read prematurely and always correspond to the most recent simulation run.

### Example Usage

```powershell
.\run_simulation.ps1 --games 5 --players 4
```
- This will build, launch, and wait for a 5-game, 4-player simulation, writing results to a uniquely named output file.

### Best Practices
- Always use the script to ensure builds are current and output files are unique.
- Let Cursor handle detection and analysis—no need to manually confirm completion.
- For custom output filenames, use the `--output` parameter.
